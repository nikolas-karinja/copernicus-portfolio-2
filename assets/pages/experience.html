            <h1 id="prog-lang">Programming Languages</h1>
            <p>The language that I am an expert in and favorite is <a>JavaScript</a> (ES Modules specifically.) It is capable of being used on almost every platform and operating system in the world. Since my favorite thing is to develop desktop applications, you would think I would choose <a>C++</a> for the job. Well to that I say yes in regards to performance, I say no in regards to ease of development. While it is true <a>C++</a> is way faster, <a>JavaScript</a> is just so extendable and is always being updated and supported to this day. Therefore it is my favorite language out of any that I have used so far.</p>

            <p>Languages that are my <a>expertise</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript (Vanilla & Node.js)</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS, SCSS, SASS</li>
                <li>Visual Basic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Languages that I am <a>profficient</a> in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Lua</li>
                <li>JSX</li>
                <li>TypeScript</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Languages that I am <a>currently learning</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carbon</li>
                <li>Rust</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Assembly</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
            <p>My end goal and reason for being a programmer and programming ingeneral is so I can build games. Of course as a kid, I played many games, the main inspirations for my love for them being <a>Minecraft</a>, and the franchises being <a>Age of Empires</a>, <a>SimCity</a>, <a>Elder Scrolls</a>, and <a>Fallout</a>. Since I was 12, I have been developing almost too many unfinished games, due to my ever-changing idea of perfection and my knowledge of syntax getting better over the years. It's been a long process, but I know that some failure and hard-learning lead to the best results in the end.</p>
            <p>One of the games I have been working off and on with, constantly rewriting the code and gameplay would be my game <a>Victorum</a> (used to be known as <a>Colonial Warfare</a>.) It's a historical 4X / simulation game about the <a>Age of Colonialism</a>. It begins in the <a>Age of Discovery</a> and ends at the end of the <a>Age of Imperialism</a>. That's my inner-geek coming out though, which if you get to know me, will come out every once in a while. At the moment, this game is being built with <a>Node.js</a>, <a>ElectronJS</a>, <a>JavaScript</a>, <a>HTML</a>, and <a>SASS</a>. The library used to display 3D objects is a proprietary game engine I built that utilizes <a>Three.js</a>.</p>
            <p>This game is still a work-in-progress and probably won't be completed for a long time.</p>

            <h1 id="webgl-threejs">WebGL / Three.js</h1>
            <p>Over the last 2 years, I have been learing about how to implement 3D into the web. Since I was using JavaScript, I needed to find a library that had an easy-to-use API and dedicated community. This way if I ran into an issue, I could get a decent amount of useful help from others. I was originally going to use <a>BabylonJS</a>, but it seemed that <a>Three.js</a> was easier to use out of the box. That became the catalyst for my love and interest in <a>Three.js</a>.</p>
            <p>Initially I wanted to use it for my games, and I still do, but I realized it was capable of so much. I started to learn how to create procedurally-generated terrain and landscapes, which were so mezmorizing to look at when I was complete with them. I even posted it to the <a>Three.js Showcase</a> and <a>Mr. Doob</a>, the creator of the library, liked it himself. You can view my showcase <a href="https://discourse.threejs.org/t/low-poly-terrain-demo-wip/33859" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, although the link to the demo doesn't work anymore.</p>
            <p>My knowledge since then has become immense. With my understanding of <a>WebGL</a>, <a>Three.js</a>, and <a>ECS Architecture</a>, I have built my own game engine. You can see this on my <a>Projects</a> page.</p>
        
            <h1 id="node-npm">Node.js / NPM</h1>
            <p>When I wanted start building games, I also wanted them to have online-connectivity. Since I was already invested in JavaScript, I was looking for something that would enable my JavaScript apps to connect to a server. Low and behold, I found <a>Node.js</a>. Not only was it perfectly integrated with JavaScript, it also has many libraries and <a>NPM packages</a> to make building my apps easier. Since it was also the most modern way to go, I decided to use that to accomplish my goals.</p>
            <p>With learning <a>Node.js</a>, I learned how to use lots of packages such as <a>Socket.io</a>, learned how to communicate with the local file-system, and much more related things. Of course in the process, I have created many of my own <a>NPM Packages</a> which include and Entity Component System, the <a>Dimensional Engine</a>, some app utilities to make my development easier, and a simple NPM Package hierarchy builder. A few of my non-depreciated packages can be found under the JavaScript section on my <a>Projects</a> page.</p>
            <p>Along the line, I learned how to use and implement <a>ElectronJS</a> for building multi-platform apps. It's a perfect solution for doing so compared to the dystopian wasteland of outdated options out there.</p>
        
            <h1 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h1>
            <p>To be honest, I don't like using external frameworks unless I built them. Sometimes working with the ones out there can be really clunky and inefficient for my projects. While I do prefer to develop and interact with my own in-house frameworks, I realize that sometimes, especially for bigger team projects, that it is good to use them. That being said, I am very familiar with <a>React</a> and its "native" brother. I am considering looking into other frameworks, but react seems to be the most widely used one for most teams.</p>
            <p>The biggest and most relevant project of mine that is currently being built with <a>React</a> is my game engine, the <a>Dimensional Engine</a>, which you have probably seen mentioned a few times throughout your reading now.</p>
