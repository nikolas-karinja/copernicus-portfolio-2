            <h1 id="prog-lang">Programming Languages</h1>
            <p>The language that I am an expert in and favorite is <a>JavaScript</a>. It is capable of being used on almost every platform and operating system in the world. Since my favorite thing is to develop desktop applications, you would think I would choose <a>C++</a> for the job. Well to that I say yes in regards to performance, I say no in regards to ease of development. While it is true <a>C++</a> is way faster, <a>JavaScript</a> is just so extendable and is always being updated and supported to this day. Therefore it is my favorite language out of any that I have used so far.</p>

            <p>Languages that are my <a>expertise</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript (Vanilla & Node.js)</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS, SCSS, SASS</li>
                <li>Visual Basic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Languages that I am <a>profficient</a> in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Lua</li>
                <li>JSX</li>
                <li>TypeScript</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Languages that I hope to learn:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carbon</li>
                <li>Rust</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Assembly</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My end goal and reason for being a programmer and programming ingeneral is so I can build games. Of course as a kid, I played many games, the main inspirations for my love for them being <a>Minecraft</a>, and the franchises being <a>Age of Empires</a>, <a>SimCity</a>, <a>Elder Scrolls</a>, and <a>Fallout</a>. Since I was 12, I have been developing almost too many unfinished games, due to my ever-changing idea of perfection and my knowledge of syntax getting better over the years. It's been a long process, but I know that some failure and hard-learning lead to the best results in the end.</p>
            <p>One of the games I have been working off and on with, constantly rewriting the code and gameplay would be my game <a>Victorum</a> (used to be known as <a>Colonial Warfare</a>.) It's a historical 4X / simulation game about the <a>Age of Colonialism</a>. It begins in the <a>Age of Discovery</a> and ends at the end of the <a>Age of Imperialism</a>. That's my inner-geek coming out though, which if you get to know me, will come out every once in a while. At the moment, this game is being built with <a>Node.js</a>, <a>ElectronJS</a>, <a>JavaScript</a>, <a>HTML</a>, and <a>SASS</a>. The library used to display 3D objects is a proprietary game engine I built that utilizes <a>Three.js</a>.</p>
            <p>This game is still a work-in-progress and probably won't be completed for a long time.</p>

            <h1 id="webgl-threejs">WebGL / Three.js</h1>
            <p>Over the last 2 years, I have been learing about how to implement 3D into the web. Since I was using JavaScript, I needed to find a library that had an easy-to-use API and dedicated community. This way if I ran into an issue, I could get a decent amount of useful help from others. I was originally going to use <a>BabylonJS</a>, but it seemed that <a>Three.js</a> was easier to use out of the box. That became the catalyst for my love and interest in <a>Three.js</a>.</p>
            <p>Initially I wanted to use it for my games, and I still do, but I realized it was capable of so much. I started to learn how to create procedurally-generated terrain and landscapes, which were so mezmorizing to look at when I was complete with them. I even posted it to the <a>Three.js Showcase</a> and <a>Mr. Doob</a>, the creator of the library, liked it himself. You can view my showcase <a href="https://discourse.threejs.org/t/low-poly-terrain-demo-wip/33859" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, although the link to the demo doesn't work anymore.</p>
            <p>My knowledge since then has become immense. With my understanding of <a>WebGL</a>, <a>Three.js</a>, and <a>ECS Architecture</a>, I have built my own game engine. You can see this on my <a>Projects</a> page.</p>
