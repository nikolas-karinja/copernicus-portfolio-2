# App Utils

[![NPM Package][npm]][npm-url]

#### Makes simple tasks even easier.

Developed by [Nikolas Karinja](http://nikolaskarinja.com/)

The aim was to make simple concepts in JavaScript take even less time to implement. In the process of making my own applications, I realized it would be a lot easier to have a base set of functions and classes that I could use with all my apps. Now you can have access to them as well, and most of my packages are updated weekly if not daily. 

## Installation

I only have the option for NPM at the moment.

### npm

```
npm i --save @nikolas.karinja/app-utils
```

## Usage

This package is meant to be used with ES Modules.

### HTML Tag

```html
<script src='node_modules/@nikolas.karinja/app-utils/build/app-utils.js' type='module'></script>
```

### Script (ES Module)

```javascript
// Using parcel or another package manager

import * as AppUtils from '@nikolas.karinja/app-utils'

// Using default file system

import * as AppUtils from 'node_modules/@nikolas.karinja/app-utils/build/app-utils.js'
```

## Usage

- This version utilizes [`three@0.146.0`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
- Most methods have [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) descriptions.
- I will post documentation soon.

#### Example

I will post examples and documentation soon. Although, since the functions and classes all have [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) descriptions, it's pretty self-explanatory. Enjoy the simplicity.
